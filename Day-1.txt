AGENDA:	
	V Model
	Agile
	Software testing
	CI/CD

Evaluation Criteria:
	MCQ test
	Applied Learning Report (Everyday)



Stages in release of product/software
	unit
	integrated
	system
	acceptance
	alpha
	beta
	RC
	
Stoping criteria for Testing - Unless all the requirements are met.
Defect - Features not meeting up the requirements as expected.


simple and complicated - V model (Requirements are cristal clear and has also gone through same project)
Complexecd - V also fits well but Agile is the best (Requirements are unknown)

TODO:
Tea/coffee dispensing machine -(V model)
	Requirements
	 - High level req (feature based req)
	 	Quanity of beverage	
	 - Low level
	 	Different types of coffee
	 	power - working parameter
	 	grinding equip for coffee bean
	 	
	 SEGMENT 1
	1. Define Product - Beverage Dispenser Machine
	2. Research - Agiging and costing (Document the referencing)
	3. Define your product -(my own feature)
	4. SWOT analysis (4-3-2 are repeatitive)
	5. Requirements	
		High Level - Feature level
			Requirement ID and Description
		Low level - how do that feature is working
			Requirement ID and Description
			
		 SEGMENT 2	
	  System design (UML diagram - Structural and Behavioral)
	  	HL - Minimum 2 and Maximum 3
	  	LL - Minimum 2 and Maximum 3
	  	
	  	
	  	SEGMENT 3
	  Two Test Plan
	  	Integration Level Test plan - High Level
	  	Unit Test Plan - Low level
	  	
	  	Table - 5 columns
	  	Test Id	test descp	Expected Inp 	Expected Op 	Actual Op
	  	
	  	
	  	
	  	Behavioural - use case,flowchart
	  	Structural - component dia
	  			s/w component dia - class dia
	  			h/w component dia - 
	  			
	  	Req based test
	  	scenario based
	  	boundary condition based
